# Level 1: Requirements & Test Scenarios FIRST

## What
Define complete business requirements, test scenarios, and acceptance criteria BEFORE writing any code. This is the foundation of true shift-left testing.

## Why
- **Prevents Rework**: Clear requirements upfront reduce expensive code changes
- **Testability by Design**: Test scenarios drive development decisions
- **Shared Understanding**: All stakeholders agree on what "done" means
- **Quality Baseline**: Performance and security requirements defined from day one

## How
1. Document business requirements with acceptance criteria
2. Write test scenarios in Given-When-Then format
3. Define edge cases and error scenarios
4. Set performance SLAs (non-negotiable targets)
5. Specify security requirements
6. Get stakeholder sign-off BEFORE coding

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 100% requirements have acceptance criteria
- ✅ All edge cases identified and documented
- ✅ Performance SLAs quantified (<200ms, 1000 TPS)
- ✅ Security requirements mapped to test scenarios
- ✅ Stakeholder approval obtained

## Next Level
Level 2: API-First Design (Contract-First)
